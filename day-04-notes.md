  - Availability. Means date is accessible to those authorized to access it.

- NIST CSF. (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
  - The NIST CSF is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risks.
  - Security teams use it as a baseline to manage short and long term cybersecurity risks.

- Ethics of security.
  - Security ethics are guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.
  - Ethical principles in security.
    - Confidentiality. As it relates to professional ethics means that there needs to be a high level of respect for privacy to safeguard private assets and data.
