ðŸŽ¯ Focus: Security Domains

## ðŸ“˜ Concepts Learned

- Eight Security Domains
  - Security Posture. An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change.

- Domains
  - Security and Risk Management. Focused on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.
    - Risk Mitigation. The process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.
    - Business Continuity. An organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.
    - InfoSec. Refers to a set of processes established to secure information. There are many InfoSec design processes, such as:
      - Incident Response.
      - Vulnerability Management.
      - Application Security.
      - Cloud Security.
      - Infrastructure Security.

  - Asset Security. Focused on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

  - Security Architecture and Engineering. Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effect tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect and organization's assets and data.
    - Shared Responsibility. All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security.

  - Communication and Network Security. Focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.

  - Identity and Access Management. Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets. The are 4 main components to IAM.
    - Identification: when a user verifies who they are by providing a user name, an access card, or biometric data such as a finger print.
    - Authentication: the verification process to provide a person's identity, such as entering a password or PIN.
    - Authorization: takes place after a user's identity has been confirmed and related to their level of access, which depends on their role in the organization.
    - Accountability: refers to monitoring and recording user actions, like login attempts, to prove systems and data are used properly.

  - Security Assessment and Testing. Focused on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

  - Security Operations. Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

  - Software Development Security. Focused on using secure coding practices.

- Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities
  - Threat: Any circumstance or even that can negatively impact assets.
    - Social Engineering Attack: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

  - Risk: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
    - Low: information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.
    - Medium: information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.
    - High: information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.

  - Vulnerability: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

- Seven Steps of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) RMF
  - Prepare. Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.

  - Categorize. Used to develop risk management processes and tasks.

  - Select. Choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization.

  - Implement. Implement security and privacy plans for the organization.

  - Assess. Determine if established controls are implemented correctly.

  - Authorize. Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization.

  - Monitor. Be aware of how systems are operating.
