# Cybersecurity Notes

This repository is a structured record of my cybersecurity learning journey. It contains daily notes, weekly reflections, and monthly recaps as I progress through training, hands-on labs, and projects.

The goal of this repository is twofold:  
1. To reinforce my own understanding of core cybersecurity concepts.  
2. To provide a transparent record of growth that can be shared with peers, mentors, and potential employers.
