ðŸŽ¯ Focus: Learning the CIA Triad + Risk Basics

---

## ðŸ“˜ Concepts Learned
- What is the CIA Triad?
  - The CIA Triad means confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    - Confidentiality is all about keeping sensitive information private. Only people who are supposed to see it should be able to.
    - Integrity means being able to trust your date. It shouldn't be altered without permission.
    - Availability means keeping systems, networks, and devices up and running.
- Real world examples.
  - Confidentiality: Using encryption so attackers can't read sensitive data like credit card numbers.
  - Integrity: Digital signatures on software updates to confirm the code wasn't altered by attackers.
  - Availability: Redundant servers and DDos protection to keep online banking available 24/7.

- Key Definitions
  - Threat: A potential cause of harm to information or systems (hacker, malware, insider misuse).
  - Vulnerability: A weakness that a threat could exploit.
  - Risk: The likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the resulting damage.
  - Impact: The actual consequence if the risk materializes.

- Why the CIA Triad Matters
  - The CIA Triad is the foundation of cybersecurity because it gives a clear framework for protecting information. Every security control or policy ultimately supports confidentiality, integrity, or availability. If one of the three pillars is weak, systems and data are at risk of compromise. Cybersecurity professionals use the CIA Triad to evalulate risk, design defenses, and prioritize reponses to incidents.
