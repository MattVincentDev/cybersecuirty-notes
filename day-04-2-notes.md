## ðŸ“˜ Concepts Learned

- SIEM Tools (Security Information and Event Management). This is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.
  - Commonly used SIEM tools:
    - Splunk. Splunk is a data analysis platform, and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions. Splunk Enterprise is a self hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data.
    - Chronicle. Chronicle is a cloud native SIEM tool that stores security date for search and analysis. Cloud native means that Chronicle allows for fast delivery of new features.

- Playbooks. A manual that provides details about any operational action.

- Network Protocol Analyzers. Also called a Packet Sniffer. A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.

- Linux Operating System.
- Program languages such as SQL and Python.

- Logs. A log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems. Logs help security professionals identify vulnerabilities and potential security breaches.

- Two types of playbooks
  - Chain of Custody playbook. Chain of custody is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle.
  - Protecting and Preserving Evidence playbook. This is the process of properly working with fragile and volatile digital evidence. As we follow this playbook, we will consult the 'order of volatility', which is a sequence outlining the order of data that must be preserved from first to last. It prooritizes volatile data, which is data that may be lost if the device in question powers off, regardless of the reason.

- Forensic Investigations as a possible career path.

- Programming. Organizations can use programming to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.

- Linux. A common use for linux for entry level security analysts is examining logs to better understand what's occurring in a system.

- SQL. (Structured Query Language). A programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. An entry level security analyst would use SQL to filter through the data points to retrieve specific information.

- Python. Security professionals can use Python to perform tasks that are repetitive and time consuming that require a high level of detail and accuracy.

Reflection

- Today I learned about forensic investigations as a possible career path.
- The more tools you know the more valuable you are to an organization.
- Create and update my resume and portfolio as we go. The more proactive I am about creating a polished portfolio, the higher your chances of impressing a potential employer and obtaining a new job opportunity in the cybersecurity profession.
- Learning the importance of these daily notes and also the importance of preparing for employment from day one.
