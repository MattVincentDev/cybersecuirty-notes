# Day 6 â€“ Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

ðŸ“… Date: 2025-08-26
ðŸŽ¯ Focus: Security Frameworks and Controls

---

## ðŸ“˜ Concepts Learned

- Security Frameworks. Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. Frameworks support organization's ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations.

- Security Controls. Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. Security controls are the measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy.
  - Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
  - Authentication is the process of verifying who someone or something is.
  - Authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources within a system.

- Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)
  - The CTF was developed by the US government to provide "a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity." By providing a common language to communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently.
- International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001.
  - An internationally recognized and used framework. The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties. This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization's ability to manage risks.

- CIA Triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
  - Confidentiality. Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
  - Integrity. The data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
  - Availability. Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

- NIST Framework (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
  - CSF (Cybersecurity Framework) is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.
    - The CSF now consists of six important core functions.
      - Govern (new)
      - Identify
      - Protect
      - Detect
      - Respond
      - Recover
  - NIST CSF expands into the US Government with NIST S.P. 800-53
    - This is a unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the federal government.

- The Six Functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
  - Govern. A significant update to the latest version of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. This function emphasizes the importance of strong cybersecurity governance across all levels of the organization. Its about establishing and maintaining the structures and processes needed to effectively manage cybersecurity risk. This includes things like setting clear cybersecurity objectives, ensuring leadership commitment, developing and implementing a comprehensive risk management strategy, and continuously improving cybersecurity performance.

  - Identify. The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets.

  - Protect. The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.

  - Detect. Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.

  - Respond. Making sure that proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.

  - Recover. The process of returning affected systems back to normal operations.

- OWASP Security Principles (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)
  - Minimize the attack surface area. Refers to all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.
  - Principle of least privilege. Means making sure users have the least amount of access require to perform their everyday tasks.
  - Defense in depth. An organization should have multiple security controls.
  - Separation of duties. This mean that no one should be given so many privileges that they can misuse the system.
  - Keep security simple.
  - Fix security issues correctly.

- Additional OWASP Security Principles.
  - Establish secure defaults. This means that the optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users.
  - Fail securely. This means that when a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option. Fort example, when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones.
  - Don't trust services. Many organizations use third party partners. These partners often have different security policies than the organization does. The organization shouldn't explicitly trust that their partner's systems are secure.
  - Avoid security by obscurity. The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. It should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defense in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.

- Plan a security audit. This is a review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations
  - Internal Security Audit is typically conducted by a team of people that might include an organization's compliance officer, security manager, and other security team members.

  - Purpose of internal security audits.
    - Identify organizational risk
    - Assess controls
    - Correct compliance issues.

  - Common elements of internal audits.
    - Establishing the scope and goals
      - Scope refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit. Goals are an outline of the organization's security objectives.
    - Conducting a risk assessment
      - This is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards.
    - Completing a controls assessment
    - Assessing compliance
    - Communicating results to stakeholders

- Complete a security audit.
  - Questions to ask
    - What is the audit meant to achieve?
    - Which asset are most at risk?
    - Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
    - What controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?

  - Audit Checklist
    - Identify the scope of the audit
      - List assets that will be assessed
      - Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
      - Indicate how often an audit should be performed
      - Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees.
    - Complete a Risk Assessment. Used to evaluate identified organization risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards.
    - Conduct the Audit. When conducting an internal audit, you will asses the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.
    - Create a mitigation plan. This is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization's security posture.
    - Communicate results to stakeholders. The end results of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.

ðŸ§  Reflection

- Don't be too overwhelmed with trying to understand every single specialization with cybersecurity. Get the fundamentals down and be persistent.
- Conducting the mock security audit was fun. I could see myself being very detailed in this area of an entry level analyst.
- There will be a lot of repetition, the course is designed that way.
