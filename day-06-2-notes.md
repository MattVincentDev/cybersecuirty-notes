## ðŸ“˜ Concepts Learned

- Analyzing Log Data. A Log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems and networks.
  - Common Log Sources
    - Firewall Logs. A firewall log is a record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet. It also includes outbound requests to the internet from within the network.
    - Network Logs. A network log is a record of all computer and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and services on the network.
    - Server Logs. A server log is a record of events related to services, such as websites, emails, or file shares. It includes actions such as login, password, and username requests.

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. It provides real time visibility, event monitoring and analysis, and automated alerts. It also stores all log data in a centralized location.

- SIEM Dashboards.
  - Metrics. Key technical attributes, such as response time, availability, and failure rate, which are used to assess the performance of a software application.

- The Future of SIEM Tools. As cybersecurity continues to evolve, the need for cloud functionality has increased.
- Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows, that uses automation to respond to security events.

- Industry Leading SIEM Tools
  - Self Hosted. Require organizations to install, operate, and maintain the tool using their own physical infrastructure, such as server capacity. These applications are then managed and maintained by the organization's IT department, rather than a third party vendor. Self hosted SIEM tools are ideal when an organization is required to maintain physical control over confidential data.
  - Cloud Hosted. These are SIEM tools maintained and managed by the SIEM providers, making them accessible through the internet. Cloud hosted SIEM tools are ideal for organizations that don't want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure.
  - Hybrid. Organizations might choose a hybrid SIEM solution to leverage the benefits of the cloud while also maintaining physical control over confidential data.

- Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud, and Chronicle.
  - Splunk Enterprise is a self hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data to provide security information and alerts in real time.
  - Splunk Cloud is a cloud hosted tool used to collect, search, and monitor log data.
  - Chronicle is cloud native tool designed to retain, analyze and search data. Made by Google. Chronicle provides log monitoring, data analysis, and data collection.

- More about Cybersecurity Tools
  - Open Source Tools are often free to use and can be user friendly. The objective of open source tools is to provide users with software that is built by the public in a collaborative way, which can results in the software being more secure.
    - Examples of Open Sources Tools
      - Linux. Is an open source operating system.
      - Suricata is an open source network analysis and threat detection software. Network analysis and threat detection software is used to inspect network traffic to identify suspicious behavior and generate network data logs.
  - Proprietary Tools are developed and owned by a person or company, and users typically pay a few for usage and training.

- USE SIEM Tools to Protect Organizations
  - Splunk offers different SIEM tool options: Enterprise and Cloud. Both allow you to review an organization's data on dashboards. This helps security professionals manage an organization's internal infrastructure by collecting, searching, monitoring, and analyzing data from multiple sources to obtain full visibility into an organization's everyday operations.
    - Security Posture Dashboard is designed for security operations centers (SOCs). It displays the 24 hours of an organization's notable security related events and trends and allows security professionals to determine if security infrastructure and policies are performing as designed.
    - Executive Summary Dashboard analyzes and monitors the overall health of the organization over time. This helps security teams improve security measures that reduce risk.
    - Incident Review Dashboard allows analysts to identify suspicious patterns that can occur in the event of an incident. It assists by highlighting higher risk items that need immediate review by an analyst.
    - Risk Analysis Dashboard helps analysts identify risk for each risk object. It shows change in risk related activity or behavior, such as a user logging in outside of normal working hours or unusually high network traffic from a specific computer.

  - Chronicle is a cloud native SIEM tool from Google that retains, analyzes and searches log data to identify potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. Chronicle allows you to collect and analyze log data according to:
    - A specific asset
    - A domain name
    - A user
    - An IP address
  - Enterprise Insights Dashboard highlights recent alerts. It identifies suspicious domain names in logs, known as indicators of compromise (IOCs). Each result is labeled with a confidence score to indicate the likelihood of a threat. A security analyst might use this dashboard to monitor login or data access attempts related to a critical asset, like an application or system, from unusual locations or devices.
  - Data Ingestion and Health Dashboard shows the number of event logs, log sources, and success rates of data being process into Chronicle. A security analyst might use this dashboard to ensure that log sources are correctly configured and that logs are received without error.
  - IOC Matches Dashboard indicates the top threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to the organization. Security professionals use this dashboard to observe domain names, IP addresses, and device IOCs over time in order to identify trends. This information is then used to direct the security team's focus to the highest priority threats.
  - Main Dashboard displays high level summary of information related to the organization's data ingestion, alerting, and event activity over time. Security professionals can use this dashboard to access a timeline of security events, such as a spike in failed login attempts, to identify threat trends across log sources, devices, IP addresses, and physical locations.
  - Rule Detections Dashboard provides statistics related to incidents with the highest occurrences, severities, and detections over time. Security analysts can use this dashboard to access a list of all the alerts triggered by a specific detection rule, such as a rule designed to alert whenever a user opens a known malicious attachment from an email.
  - User Sign In Overview Dashboard provides information about user access behavior across the organization. Security analysts can use this dashboard to access a list of all user sign in events to identify unusual activity, such as a user signing in from multiple locations at the same time.

ðŸ§  Reflection

- While ai and automation will be a big part of the field of cybersecurity it seems like it will be more of a tool for analysts than replacing most positions.
- You do not need to be a math wiz to be in this field.
- You do not need to have a cybersecurity degree either.
- Be okay creating your own path into cybersecurity.
- A lot of information an terms in today's lesson. I will come back to review more at the end of the week for a refresher.
- Today was the most info packed day and feels like it is getting more hands on.
