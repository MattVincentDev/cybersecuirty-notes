## ðŸ“˜ Concepts Learned
- Common Attacks and their Effectiveness
  - Phishing. This is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.
    - Business Email Compromise (BEC). A threat actor sends and email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.
    - Spear Phishing. A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. This email seems to originate from a trusted source.
    - Whaling. A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive date.
    - Vishing. The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
    - Smishing. The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

  - Malware. This is a software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, and intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, and organization, or a territory.
    - Viruses. Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
    - Worms. Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own.
    - Ransomware. A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's date and demand paym,ent to restore access.
    - Spyware. Malware that's used to gather and sell information without consent.

  - Social Engineering. This is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
    - Social media phishing. A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then they initiate an attack.
    - Watering hole attack. A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
    - USB baiting. A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.
    - Physical social engineering. A threat actor impersonates and employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

  - Keep your cool during a data breach.
    - Everyone around you will be freaking out. You need to be the one who remains calm.
    - First thing to do is to contain the breach. (shut down servers, networks etc.)
    - Stop breach. Investigate breach.
    - Executing your incident management by plan is the most important thing that an entry level person can keep in mind.

  - Eight CISSP security domains. (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)
    - Security and Risk Management. Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.
    - Asset Security. This domain focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
    - Security Architecture and Engineering. This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place.
    - Communication and Network Security. This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
    - Identity and Access Management. This focuses on keeping date secure, by securing users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.
    - Security Assessment and Testing. This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
    - Security Operations. This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
    - Software Development Security. This domain focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.

- HACKING GOOGLE Series. on YouTube.
  - This series has really ignited an initial love for the cybersecurity industry.
  - Learning about the ways someone can get access (usb devices like mice and keyboards) is incredibly interesting, and scary.
  - Peter Bogis is a legend.
  - The job of cybersecurity gets harder and harder every year, it is always a challenge.

Reflection

- It is quite incredible what can have a vulnerability and how they can be exploited.
- It is also fascinating how deep this industry is.
- A really cool feeling that you can be a part of a team helping people.
- It is not just companies and enterprises are being attacked but real people too.
