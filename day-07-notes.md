ðŸŽ¯ Focus: Use Playbooks to Respond to Incidents

## ðŸ“˜ Concepts Learned

- Playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Playbooks also clarify what tools should be used in response to a security incident.

- Incident Response. Is an organization's quick attempt to identify an attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach.

- Incident Response Playbook is a guide with six phases used to help mitigate and manage security incidents from beginning to end.
  - Preparation. Organizations must prepare to mitigate the likelihood, risk, and impact of a security incident by documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans, and educating users. Preparation sets the foundation for successful incident response.
  - Detection and Analysis. The objective of this phase is to detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology. Using appropriate tools and strategies during this phase helps security analysts determine whether a breach has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude.
  - Containment. The goal of containment is to prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident. During this phase, security professionals take action to contain an incident and minimize damage. Containment is a high priority for organizations because it helps prevent ongoing risks to critical assets and data.
  - Eradication and Recovery. This phase involves the complete removal of an incident's artifacts so that an organization can return to normal operations. During this phase, security professionals eliminate artifacts of the incident by removing malicious code and mitigating vulnerabilities. Once they've exercised due diligence, they can begin to restore the affect environment to a secure state. This is also known as IT restoration.
  - Post Incident Activity. This phase includes documenting the incident, informing organizational leadership, and applying lessons learned to ensure that an organization is better prepared to handle future incidents.
  - Coordination. Coordination involves reporting incidents and sharing information, throughout the incident response process, based on an organization's established standards.

- Playbooks are updated often. Updates are often made if:
  - A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself.
  - There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.
  - The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.

- Playbooks and SIEM Tools.
  - Playbooks are used by cybersecurity teams in the even of an incident. Playbooks help security teams respond to incidents by ensuring that a consistent list of actions are followed in a prescribed way, regardless of who is working on the case. Playbooks are also used for recovery procedures. Playbooks are generally used alongside SIEM tools. For example, unusual user behavior is flagged by a SIEM tool, a playbook provides analysts with instructions about to to address the issue.

  - Playbooks and SOAR Tools.
    - SOAR tools are similar to SIEM tools in that they are used for threat monitoring. SOAR is a piece of software used to automate repetitive tasks generated by tools such as a SIEM or managed detection and response (MDR). For example, if a user attempts to log into their computer too many times with the wrong password, SOAR would automatically block their account to stop possible intrusion. Then, analysts would refer to a playbook to take steps to resolve the issue.

ðŸ§  Reflection

Playbooks. They are super important because they allow you to resolve incidents with the expertise of a much more experienced analyst.

Talk to as many people in the cybersecurity industry as possible to really get a feel for what the job and industry is like.
